# text-to-speech-generator

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to use Python and the pyttsx3 library to convert text to speech. The code splits a text input into sentences, and then uses the pyttsx3 engine to speak each sentence.
Getting Started

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can check if you have it installed by running the following command in your terminal:
Copy code
python --version 

You will also need to install the pyttsx3 and nltk libraries. You can do this by running the following commands:
Copy code
pip install pyttsx3 pip install nltk 

Installing
1.	Clone this repository or download the Jupyter Notebook file.
2.	Open the Jupyter Notebook file using a Jupyter Notebook application (such as Anaconda or JupyterLab).
3.	Run the cells in the notebook.
4.	
How to Use
1.	When prompted, enter the text you want to convert to speech.
2.	When prompted, select the language, voice, gender, and accent you want to use for the speech.
3.	Wait for the speech to be generated and played back to you.
4.	If you want to download the generated audio file, follow the link provided in the output.
